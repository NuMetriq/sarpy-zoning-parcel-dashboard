\# Sarpy County Zoning Structure Dashboard  

\### Executive Overview



This dashboard provides a \*\*structural inventory of zoning impacts on parcels\*\* within Sarpy County, Nebraska and its municipalities.



It answers a narrow but foundational question:



> \*How are parcels distributed across zoning districts, by jurisdiction, in practice?\*



---



\## What This Tool Is



\- A jurisdiction-aware zoning inventory

\- A parcel-grounded view of zoning structure

\- A transparency and data-quality diagnostic tool



It is designed for \*\*planning staff, analysts, and decision-makers\*\* who need reliable descriptive insight before engaging in deeper policy or land-use analysis.



---



\## What the Dashboard Shows



\### Zoning impact by parcel count

Which zoning categories govern the most parcels within a jurisdiction.



\### Zoning structure by land area

How much land area each zoning category occupies within a jurisdiction.



\### Side-by-side jurisdiction comparison

Direct comparison of zoning distributions across municipalities such as Bellevue, Papillion, and La Vista.



\### Data quality \& coverage

Clear indicators of:

\- parcel coverage

\- zoning assignment completeness

\- geometry health



This allows users to assess confidence in the results.



---



\## What This Tool Does \*Not\* Do



\- It does not evaluate zoning policy quality or effectiveness

\- It does not measure land value, density outcomes, or compliance

\- It does not replace detailed parcel-level GIS workflows



The dashboard is \*\*descriptive, not prescriptive\*\*.



---



\## Why This Matters



Before policy analysis, rezoning discussions, or housing studies can proceed responsibly, planners need to understand the \*\*existing zoning structure as it actually applies to parcels\*\*.



This tool provides:

\- a defensible baseline

\- a shared factual reference point

\- transparency into data limitations



---



\## Data \& Methodology (High Level)



\- Public GIS data published by Sarpy County

\- Parcel-to-zoning spatial joins with deduplication

\- Geometry repair and validation

\- Jurisdiction-aware aggregation

\- Area calculations performed in a projected CRS for accuracy



---



\## Intended Use



This dashboard is intended to support:

\- internal planning analysis

\- scoping and workload estimation

\- data validation and QA

\- preparation for downstream studies



It is not a substitute for formal planning judgments or legal interpretation.
